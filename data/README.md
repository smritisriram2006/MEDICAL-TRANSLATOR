# 💊 Doctor-Patient Medical Translator (English to Tamil)

This project is a web-based translation tool designed to bridge the communication gap between English-speaking doctors and Tamil-speaking patients. It focuses specifically on medical terminology and common consultation sentences to provide accurate and context-aware translations.

## 🎯 Purpose

In many healthcare settings, language barriers can hinder effective communication, diagnosis, and treatment. This tool provides a simple, accessible solution by offering instant, voice-enabled translation of medical phrases, ensuring clarity and improving patient care.

## ✨ Features

- **Hybrid Translation:** Uses a custom medical dictionary for high-accuracy translations of specific terms and falls back on a general translation API for conversational phrases.
- **Voice Input:** Allows users to speak directly into the application for hands-free use.
- **Text Input:** Standard text area for typing or pasting text.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Automatically plays the translated Tamil text as audio, making it accessible to patients with low literacy.
- **Simple Web Interface:** Built with Streamlit for a clean, fast, and user-friendly experience.
